                Several years ago I was working part time. Being a Mother of 2 at that a time. 
                 I didn't have much time for socializing either.
                
               I was always into trying  new Recipes n stuff, I wanted to try homemade cakes. I was not a skilled baker, in fact I was really quite bad at it but I was determined. First time  I made a  cake.It  was very simple but it turned out great. Folks around me really enjoyed my cakes.
                
                That first cake lead to another and soon my inbox started to fill with "My birthday is coming up soon" emails. My baking became a part-time job and I learned a ton.

                As for me, I am Learning Web Development at this point  and planning to make a  living as a professional Web Developer. I live in Munich, Germany and I love spending time with my family. I also love cooking, corny jokes and swooning over good sheets. I have a weakness for good books and good Animie.
